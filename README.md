# ArcaneOS

**ArcaneOS** is a magical computing system that allows its user (the protagonist) to create, upgrade, and execute powerful spells based on computational principles. It combines the logical power of an Operating System with the mystical energy of arcane magic, enabling complex spellcasting, resource management, and environment manipulation.

## Features

- **Function-based Spellcasting**: Cast spells as functions, enabling flexible and complex spell constructs.
- **Object-Oriented Magic**: View spells as objects with properties and methods, creating reusable and extendable magic constructs.
- **Resource Management**: Track mana, energy flows, and materials needed for spellcasting.
- **Distributed Spellcasting**: Utilize multiple nodes and systems to cast spells simultaneously across different regions.
- **Environment Monitoring**: Automatically track and respond to changes in the surrounding environment (e.g., temperature, weather) to trigger appropriate spells.
- **Magic Upgrades**: Choose from various upgrade paths to enhance ArcaneOS, including improving spellcasting efficiency, unlocking new abilities, or enhancing system performance.

## Structure

The repository contains the following sections:

- **Spells**: Scripts and configurations for creating and managing various spells.
- **Resources**: Data and configurations related to the flow of mana, energy, and materials.
- **System**: Core components of ArcaneOS, including kernel files, drivers, and backup systems.
- **Projects**: Large-scale, experimental spell systems and magical constructs the protagonist is working on.
- **Settings**: User preferences and system configurations, ensuring the smooth operation of the ArcaneOS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

ArcaneOS requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x or higher
- Libraries for energy flow simulation and spell calculation (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`)
- A stable connection to the magic grid for external spellcasting and system updates.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ArcaneOS.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd ArcaneOS
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any) or simply start using the existing configurations and scripts for spellcasting.

## Usage

### Running a Spell:

1. Navigate to the desired spell directory (e.g., `M:/Users/Ling/Spells/FunctionSpells`).
2. Open the spell script you want to execute.
3. Modify any parameters (e.g., target temperature for a cooling spell).
4. Execute the script using ArcaneOS's system kernel.

Example: Running a cooling spell to reduce environmental temperature by 10Â°C.

```python
from cooling_spell import cast
cast(target_temperature=10)
```

### Upgrading ArcaneOS:

To update ArcaneOS to the latest version, simply run the upgrade script in the `M:/Users/Ling/System/Updates` directory.

```bash
python upgrade.py
```

This will allow you to choose from several upgrade options (e.g., adding new spellcasting features, improving system stability).
